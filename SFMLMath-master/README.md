# SFMLMath
Simple vector math library for SFML. It uses the built-in vector types and puts its functions in the `sf` namespace to keep the usage as natural and SFML-like as possible.

## Features
#### Vector functions
* Vecotor addition
* Vector subtraction
* Scalar multiplication
* Dot product
* Length of vector
* Normalize vector
* Invert vector
* Angle between two vectors (in degrees)
* Angle of the vectors direction depending on the unit circle (in degrees)
* Rotate vector

#### Utility functions
* Square function
* Radians and Degrees conversions

## Getting started
See the [wiki](https://github.com/wagnrd/SFMLMath/wiki) for further instructions and a full documentation of every function.

Or look at the actual project [Pong](https://github.com/wagnrd/Pong) to see further usages of this library.

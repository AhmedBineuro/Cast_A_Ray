# DDA Raycasting Algorithm

## 1. Normalize Direction Vector
First, normalize the direction vector to ensure it has a length of 1.

$$
\text{length} = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}
$$
$$
\text{normalized direction} = \left( \frac{dx}{\text{length}}, \frac{dy}{\text{length}} \right)
$$

## 2. Determine Step Size
The step size for each axis can be determined by the sign of the direction vector components.

$$
\text{step} = (\text{sign}(dx), \text{sign}(dy))
$$

## 3. Calculate Delta Distances
Delta distances represent the distance the ray must travel along each axis to cross a grid line.

$$
\text{delta distance} = \left( \frac{1}{\left| \text{normalized direction}_x \right|}, \frac{1}{\left| \text{normalized direction}_y \right|} \right)
$$

## 4. Calculate Side Distances
Calculate the distance from the start position to the next grid line along each axis.

$$
\text{side distance}_x = (\text{next integer x} - \text{start}_x) \times \text{normalized direction}_x
$$
$$
\text{side distance}_y = (\text{next integer y} - \text{start}_y) \times \text{normalized direction}_y
$$

## 5. Loop Through Grid
Loop through the grid, incrementing the side distances by the delta distances and taking steps accordingly.

- Compare \(\text{side distance}_x\) and \(\text{side distance}_y\)
- If \(\text{side distance}_x < \text{side distance}_y\):
  - Increment \(\text{side distance}_x\) by \(\text{delta distance}_x\)
  - Step in x direction
- Else:
  - Increment \(\text{side distance}_y\) by \(\text{delta distance}_y\)
  - Step in y direction
- Check for wall collision and continue until a wall is hit or a maximum distance is reached

## 6. Calculate Perpendicular Distance
Calculate the perpendicular distance to the wall to avoid the fisheye effect.

$$
\text{perpendicular distance} = \frac{\text{side distance}_x \times \text{step}_x - \text{start}_x}{\text{normalized direction}_x}
$$

or

$$
\text{perpendicular distance} = \frac{\text{side distance}_y \times \text{step}_y - \text{start}_y}{\text{normalized direction}_y}
$$

depending on the axis used to hit the wall.

## 7. Render the Wall Slice
Use the perpendicular distance to calculate the wall height and render the wall slice with appropriate shading.
